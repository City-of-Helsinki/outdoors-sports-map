The Outdoor Exercise Map helps the inhabitants of the municipality find up-to-date information on the Cityâ€™s outdoor sports services. Currently, the services encompasses the skiing tracks and ice-skating fields maintained by the cities.

## Development

Follow the instructions to set up local development environment. Altertanively, you can use Docker ([see below](#development-with-docker)).

### Prerequisites

-   Preferably use current Node.js LTS
-   Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Setup

After cloning this repository, create a new `.env` file from the provided `.env.example` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

### Running the development environment

To start development server, run:

```
yarn start
```

The application is now available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Development with Docker

Install and configure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Build the project:

```
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose build
```

_(you can add `--no-cache` to the command if you don't want to use cache from previous build)_

Start the application:

```
docker-compose up
```

The application is now available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

### Starting dockerized production environment

Make sure port `8080` is free.

Pass build-time variables (replace `<VAR_X>` with actual variable name from `.env` file) to docker image and build with:

```
source .env
docker build \
--build-arg <VAR_1>=${<VAR_1>} \
--build-arg <VAR_N>=${<VAR_N>} \
-t outdoors-sports-map .
```

_(you can add `--no-cache` to the command if you don't want to use cache from previous build)_

Start docker container with:

```
docker container run -p 8080:8080 -d outdoors-sports-map
```

_(you can add `--name outdoors-sports-map` to the command for easier referencing)_

The application is now available at [http://localhost](http://localhost/).

## Environments

### Test

Test environment is done from master branch. The pipeline is triggered with a commit to master branch. Normally the commit is pull request merge. 

Test url: [https://ulkoliikunta.test.hel.ninja](https://ulkoliikunta.test.hel.ninja/).

### Review

Review environment is done from pr to master branch. The review environment url is posted to pull request when it is completed.

### Release (staging&production)

Release pipeline is triggered by tag. Tag should be named like 'release-<version>'. The release pipeline builds and deploys the staging environment by default. The production environment requires manual approval in the pipeline [ulkoliikuntakartta-ui-release](https://dev.azure.com/City-of-Helsinki/ulkoliikuntakartta/_build?definitionId=3123&_a=summary)

> Note! Approval requires 2 manual approval, one for build and one for deploy
